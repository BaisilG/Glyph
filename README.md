# Glyph

Extensions to all of Stringier for working directly with graphemes in a high level and type safe way.

This is a mixed source library. For the most part, it is closed source but feel free to file issues here. They can be linked and tracked from the system where development of this is occuring. The algorithms which power `Glyph` are table driven, and those tables are FOSS to enable easier bug fixing and contributions to the community. Adding support for a new language is as simple as adding the relevant entries in the tables. Those tables live here.
